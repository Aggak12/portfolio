            I am a multimediadesign student from Iceland with a strong interest in visual and creative design. Prior to this education, I studied digital fashion design through an online university course, as well as design and marketing in
            gymnasium, which provided me with a solid creative foundation and motivation to continue working within design. Creativity has always been a central part of my interests.

              During my first semester, I worked primarily on individual projects, with a larger group project towards the end of the semester. After an initial introduction to video production, the focus quickly shifted to web development, where I
              began working with basic HTML and CSS before moving on to UX/UI principles. Throughout the semester, I worked with user-centered design methods such as user types, user stories, digital prototyping, and user testing, including
              think-aloud tests, five-second tests, and Likert tests. I also gained experience using GitHub Pages, Lighthouse testing, vector graphics, and basic animations. While coding is still an area I am developing, I especially enjoyed the
              design process and working with visual concepts, layout, visual hierarchy, and typography.

              When approaching design tasks, I focus on creating clear and visually engaging solutions that balance aesthetics with usability. I enjoy working conceptually and refining my designs through multiple stages, using research and user
              feedback to inform design decisions. While I am still developing my technical skills in coding, I am motivated to continue learning and refining my workflow in order to create more cohesive and functional digital experiences. This
              portfolio reflects my learning process and the skills I have developed throughout the first semester.
